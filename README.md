My 00134 - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 1 (JAVA) course final project. [Spring 2019-2020]
The OOP1 principles used in this project are object, class, method overloading, constructor, this
keyword, abstract class, interface, packages etc.
I used java swing to build this application. Javax, Awt, I/O, Awt event are the packages that I have used in
this project.
